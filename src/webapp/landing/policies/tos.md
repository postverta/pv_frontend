# Acceptable Use
Your use of the Website must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Website is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any User Content that:
- is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;
- is or contains sexually obscene content;
- is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;
- is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;
- contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or
- infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.

While using Postverta, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:
- use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;
- attempt to disrupt or tamper with Postverta's servers in ways that could harm our Website, to place undue burden on Postverta's servers through automated means, or to access the Website in ways that exceed your authorization;
- impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with Postverta, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or
- violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.

If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other Postverta customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your app hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.

# User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Postverta terms or policies.

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own ("Your Content"). If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Postverta Users — certain legal permissions, listed in the following sections. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Postverta the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in the following sections. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

## License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant Postverta the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.

## License Grant to Other Users
By setting your apps to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "clone" your apps (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your apps in apps they control).

If you set your apps to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of Postverta a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Postverta Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Postverta as permitted through Postverta's functionality (for example, through cloning). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Postverta Users.

# Intellectual Property Notice
Postverta and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © Postverta Inc. All rights reserved.

You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

# Limitation of Liability
You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

- the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
- your use or inability to use the Service;
- any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
- the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
- unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
- statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
- any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
- any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

# Changes to These Terms
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price changes, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website. For non-material modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

# Governing Law
Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and Postverta and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and Postverta agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California.
